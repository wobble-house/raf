# Ross Alan Ford: Full-Stack Developer & Business Operations Wizard

## The Saga Begins
In a universe brimming with **ordinary Full-Stack Developers**, there exists a rare species: **Ross**, the self-proclaimed savior of Business Operations. With the kind of experience that makes LinkedIn profiles weep with inadequacy, this hero has spent the last six years with **A2IM**, a 501(c)6 not-for-profit in the US music business.

### The Chronicles of A2IM
There, amidst the chaos of creativity, our intrepid warrior single-handedly dragged their IT into the 21st century, introducing them to the mystical cloud. Alongside, they juggled live event productions, presumably while blindfolded, because why not?

## The Retail Revolution
Before this epoch, Ross graced a chain of retail stores in **Manhattan & Brooklyn** with their presence. Here, they dabbled in an emerging disruptive technology, casually revolutionizing their inventory systems.

## A Journey Through Industries
But letâ€™s not pigeonhole our protagonist. Their saga spans various realms:
- Industrial fiber optics (because who doesn't love a bit of networking installation)
- Medical insurance (thrilling!)
- Big-box retail (the glamour!)
- Pawn shop industry (the unexpected twist!)

## The Altruistic Turn
Now, in a twist no one saw coming, Ross has been valiantly modernizing the web infrastructure for an organization in the field of **physical therapy for traumatic brain injury patients**. 

## A Personal Note
On a personal note, Ross claims to be a **father, musician, and gamer**. Their odyssey from Tampa to Tennessee to New York City reads like a hero's journey, only with more synthesizers and less dragons. Now in Chattanooga with a son and a cat named Dwayne (because why not?).

## The Conclusion
So there you have it: **Ross Alan Ford**, not just a Full-Stack Developer, but a legend in their own lunchtime, a sarcastic savior in the silicon-saturated saga of software development. Because in a world of codes and cloud, who else are you going to call?
